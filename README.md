## Hi there 👩‍💻

I hold a **Master’s degree in Business Administration with a strong focus on statistics**.  
I genuinely love **numbers, data, and analytical thinking** — I’m a bit of a statistics nerd, and I mean that in the best way.  
My background is in **marketing**, where I focused heavily on **reporting, performance analysis, and data-driven insights**.  
I enjoy transforming raw data into **clear insights and meaningful reports**.  
My interests lie especially in **data analysis and reporting**, survey-based analysis, and quantitative research.
